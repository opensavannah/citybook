[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/citybook.png)](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/citybook)  [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/codeforamerica/citybook.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/codeforamerica/citybook)

A hybrid mobile-web app of community contacts built using react.js, tabletop.js and powered by Google Sheets.

SavBook aims to serve as a one-stop resource for social service data and resources in Greater Savannah, working toward what Greg Bloom has called an ["Open Data Approach to the Human Service Directory Problem"](https://www.academia.edu/16449530/An_Open_Data_Approach_to_the_Human_Service_Directory_Problem) (2015).

## Data Types

CityBook emphasizes simplicity and flexibility over adherence to a data standard. You can add any columns with any title to your CityBook spreadsheet and they will displayed. However, some column names are required or receive special treatment:

### Organization Name (Required)
Displayed as an `<h1>` element. It corresponds to the main title of your entry.

### Telephone
Displayed as a button that users can click or tap to launch a call. Cells should contain a single telephone number. Most mobile telephone applications are flexible in how they parse a phone number, so these may use any common telephone format (e.g. 123-456-7890, (123)456-7890, 1234567890, etc.).

### Address
Displayed as a button that launches Google Maps directions to the location in the cell. It's a good idea to test the addresses you enter by searching for them in Google Maps. If your address is incomplete or does not return a result, the user may have difficulty finding the right location.

### Other Data Types
All other data types are displayed in the "Show Details" section. The column header will appear as bold text with a colon (i.e. a Key-Value format).

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/codeforamerica/citybook.git
cd citybook
npm install
```

Create a PostgreSQL databse named citybook, or edit the development block of `config/config.js` to the name of your database. Consider using http://postgresapp.com/.
```
psql
CREATE DATABASE citybook;
\q

node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

### Development
Running in development mode enables WebpackDevServer hot-module-reloading on port 3000. Use port 8080 for testing back-end functionality.

`npm run dev`

### Bundling for Production
Bundles everything into bundle.js.

```
webpack
npm start
git remote add production https://git.heroku.com/citybook.git
```
(Open an issue to be added as a collaborator on heroku)

### Database Migration
Make your changes, then run:

`node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate`


### What is this built with?

This project uses [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) for the spreadsheet access, [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for some templating, [List.js](http://www.listjs.com/) for the searchable list, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the styles.

The instruction page template was generated by using the [Cayman theme](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme) by [Jason Long](http://github.com/jasonlong).
